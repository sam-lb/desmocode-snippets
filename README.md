# desmocode snippets

This is a collection of useful code snippets/userscripts that I've made or have found useful. There are other script repositories, most notably [Slimrunner's](https://github.com/SlimRunner/desmos-scripts-addons), but it's a bit outdated.

You can find scripts to use in the console to leverage the Desmos API, install userscripts (through Tampermonkey) to accelerate your Desmos workflow, or add some stylesheets (through an extension like Stylus) to make Desmos look more aesthetically pleasing.

## Userscripts
The userscripts in this repository are located in `/userscripts`. They include:
- `beta3d.user.js`: Small script for enabling Beta3D feature (for access to shaders, surface opacity, etc.). For more 3D features, use `better3d.user.js`.
- `better3d.user.js`: A collection of useful features for Desmos's 3D calculator. This includes the Beta3D feature, as well as optional features such as ~~adding a background color~~ (this is now broken), changing the specular, etc.
- `desmo_md.user.js`: Adds markdown rendering to note expressions. Supports headers, bold, italics, links, unordered lists, inline code, and code blocks (with syntax highlighting).
- `desmolocal.user.js`: Adds additional UI to save, load, or copy graphs in a JSON format. Useful if you want to save graphs to your own device or send a graph to someone as a file rather than a link. Also, vanilla Desmos now allows you to paste JSON into Desmos (pasting on a note on mobile also works!) and automatically replace the graph state, so this userscript is useful for copying that JSON, both on PC and mobile.
- `desmos_import_export.user.js`: Similar to `desmolocal.user.js`, but supports ALL calculator types, including the "mini" calculators like scientific and matrix. Also, rather than raw JSON, this script uses a custom file format that includes more metadata and a custom file extension.
- `fix_code_golf.js`: Turns off the Desmodder "Code Golf" plugin by default and binds the plugin toggle to "Alt + Q". This is a somewhat niche script and might become obsolete when Desmodder releases some updates.
- `force_bottom.js` Forces the expression list to be on the bottom at all times
- `godmode.user.js`: Increases the list limit, shader list limit, and tolerance of "nested too deeply" error
- `keyboard_input.user.js`: Adds keyboard input to Desmos. Paste `K_{eys}=[]` into your graph, and keycodes will now be updated in `K_{eys}`.
- `lower_error_message.user.js`: Lowers the dang error message so you can actually see the expression.
- `secret_functions.user.js`: Unlocks some secret functions that are disabled through Mathquill. These functions include `hypot`, `polyGamma`, `argmin`, and more. Some are unusable, such as `validateSampleCount`.
- `table_to_csv.user.js`: Adds a button to download table expressions to CSV.

## Console scripts
The console scripts in this repository are located in `/console_scripts`. They include:
- `dispatch.js`: A small tutorial to use Desmos's event listener, useful for making scripts that run when a certain event is triggered (e.g. clicking an expression, moving the graph, graph state change, etc.).
- `get_compiled.js`: Gets the compute context (compiled Javascript of Desmos expressions). Sort of like ASM analysis for lower-level languages, but for Desmos expressions.
- ~~`graph_history.js`: Desmos doesn't have an easy way to trace the graph history of a certain link, so this script does so.~~ *(whoops! the new graph link update broke this, we're working on fixing this)*
- `whole_screen_rec.js`: Similar to Desmodder's video capture, but captures the whole screen (including the expression bar, top bar, etc.). Modifies the first slider it finds in the expression list (RECOMMENDED: put your animation variable as the first expression). The script also adds to Desmodder's frame creator, so you can modify frames from the UI. You need to modify the `min`, `max`, and `step` constants. 

## Stylesheets
The stylesheets in this repository are located in `/styles`. They include:
- `monospace.css`: Changes font of notes and folders to monospace.
